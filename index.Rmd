<p>I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu">Goldman School of Public Policy, UC Berkeley</a>.</p>

<p>My research uses causal inference techniques and demographic methods to address how politics impact population health and wellbeing, with a particular emphasis on the role of structural racism in influencing population health across the life course.</p>
